## Some newly-learned thoughts

    - Training sets, validation sets & test sets
        - We should isolate the test sets with the training process, "just test the final model at the very end" to avoid overfitting
        - Often validation sets are extracted from training sets 

## Assignment

### Assignment 1

- K-NN (K Nearest Neighbors)

    - No training, just memorizing the data
    - In prediction, compute the **Distance** with every sample (**Costly**)
    - Use K-fold cross validation to find the best K. Concretely speaking, split the training sets into K folds, and choose each as validation set, and evaluate the model finally.
