# Welcome to FF's Notebooks

## Some interesting CS Courses

- **x86 ASM**
    - Taught by BHH, a hacker in my dream.
    - One of the most meaningful classes I've taken, where I learn from hardware implementation in computer (My fundation on ICS) to basic x86 ASM compiling and programming. 

- **Digit Logic Design**
    - Taught by CM, one of the best teacher I've met.
    - Concretely learn the basic digit design, and some basic hardware programming (Verilog)

- **CS231n**
    - My work in learning CS231n
    - It's truly the **best** course for me to learn CV
        - Give me a preliminary understanding of CV
        - Introduce many popular and typical Algorithms, **FC, CNN, RNN, Transformer, GAN, Self-Supervised ……**
        - Leads me to try to read some famous papers by myself
        - Help me gain a deeper insight into the model with moderately difficult project which can be auto-checked 

- **ADS**
    - Taught by CH, my senior and a intelligent researcher 
    - Learn some advanced data structures, algorithm, and some advanced analysis
    - Despite of my experience in Informatics Olympiad, I still feel it challenging

- **OOP**
    - Taught by WK, a famous teacher in ZJU
    - Learn some basic OOP concepts and some advanced design patterns using C++

- **Information Theory**
    - Taught by YGD, a professor in ZJU
    - Learn some basic information theory, which is significant in machine learning theory especially in proof, so I think it's necessary to take this course carefully and take notes

## Some useful tools in learning

- **Git**
    - Undoubtedly one of the most useful tools as distributed version control system
    - Workspace history recorded
    - Remote workspace storage & cooperation

- **Makefile & CMake**
    - Makefile is a tool to compile and link multiple source codes
    - CMake is a efficient tool to help generate Makefile (Basically learned to tutorial STEP3)
