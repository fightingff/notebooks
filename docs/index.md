# Welcome to FF's Notebooks

## Some interesting CS Courses

### 大一

- **x86 ASM**
    - Taught by BHH, a hacker in my dream.
    - One of the most meaningful classes I've taken, where I learn from hardware implementation in computer (My fundation on ICS) to basic x86 ASM compiling and programming.

### 大二上

- **Digit Logic Design**
    - Taught by CM, one of the best teacher I've met.
    - Concretely learn the basic digit design, and some basic hardware programming (Verilog)

- **CS231n**
    - My work in learning CS231n
    - It's truly the **best** course for me to learn CV
        - Give me a preliminary understanding of CV
        - Introduce many popular and typical Algorithms, **FC, CNN, RNN, Transformer, GAN, Self-Supervised ……**
        - Leads me to try to read some famous papers by myself
        - Help me gain a deeper insight into the model with moderately difficult project which can be auto-checked

### 大二下

- **ADS**
    - Taught by CH, my senior and a intelligent researcher 
    - Learn some advanced data structures, algorithm, and some advanced analysis
    - Despite of my experience in Informatics Olympiad, I still feel it challenging

- **OOP**
    - Taught by WK, a famous teacher in ZJU
    - Learn some basic OOP concepts and some advanced design patterns using C++
    - Additionally, I learn some advanced knowledge about C++ following the [CPlusPlusThings](https://light-city.github.io/stories_things/)

- **Information Theory**
    - Taught by YGD, a professor in ZJU
    - Learn some basic information theory, which is significant in machine learning theory especially in proof, so I think it's necessary to take this course carefully and take notes

- **Database**
    - Taught by MXY, a gentle professor and Big Data scholar in ZJU
    - Learn basic and advanced database concepts and SQL programming
    - Too many points, so I choose to fork other people's notes and take some notes by myself
    - [link](https://github.com/yile-liu/ZJU_database_system)

- **Computer Organization**
    - Taught by YK, a professor in ZJU
    - Learn some deep computer organization concepts of RISC-V structure(Single Cycle CPU, Pipelined-CPU, Cache...), which is significant in computer architecture especially in hardware design, so I think it's necessary to take this course carefully and take notes
    - Since I'm so busy in this semester, I choose to fork other people's notes and only take some additional notes

### 大三上

～迷～忙～，不知道干啥了，课程笔记主要fork别人的做一些微调

- **Computer Architecture**
    - Taught by WXH, a professor in ZJU
    - Learn some deep computer architecture concepts of RISC-V structure as "Computer Organization Plus".

- **Network**
    - Taught by ZKG, an interesting professor in ZJU
    - Learn some basic network concepts and some advanced network programming

- **Operating System**
    - Taught by SJW, a responsible professor in ZJU
    - Learn some basic OS concepts and some advanced OS programming

## Some useful tools in learning

- **Git**
    - Undoubtedly one of the most useful tools as distributed version control system
    - Workspace history recorded
    - Remote workspace storage & cooperation

- **Makefile & CMake**
    - Makefile is a tool to compile and link multiple source codes
    - CMake is a efficient tool to help generate Makefile (Basically learned to tutorial STEP3)

## Collections of Materials

- **AI Materials**
    - Record some useful and famous papers and resources in my AI learning. 

- [**My AI repositoy**](https://github.com/fightingff/AI)

    - Some little notes of my AI trying.
