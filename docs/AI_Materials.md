- [**CNN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

    - The pioneering work of CNN. The paper introduces the **convolutional layer**, **pooling layer**, **fully connected layer**, and the implementation of the CNN model.

- [**transformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

    - The pioneering work of the transformer. The paper introduces the **self-attention** mechanism and the **multi-head attention** mechanism, as well as the implementation of the transformer model.

- [**GAN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

    - The pioneering work of GAN, which introduces the **generator** and **discriminator** mechanism in GAN.
